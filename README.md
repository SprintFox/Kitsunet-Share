## Overview

**Kitsunet Share** is a fast, simple, and privacy-focused tool for sharing files inside a **local network (LAN)**.  
It automatically discovers nearby devices, requires no configuration, and works **entirely offline**.

No cloud. No accounts. No telemetry.  
Just pure local file sharing — open source and secure.

  Files move at full local network speed — no external bottlenecks.

- **Automatic device discovery**  
  Devices find each other instantly using local network broadcast protocols.

- **Privacy-first architecture**  
  Files never leave your network.  
  Zero tracking, analytics, or background connections.

- **Works fully offline**  
  Perfect for isolated, closed, or air-gapped networks.

- **Cross-platform**  
  Available for **Windows, macOS, and Linux**.

- **Open-source (GPL-3.0)**  
  You stay in control — audit the code, modify it, contribute.

## How It Works

1. All devices run **Kitsunet Share** in the same LAN.  
2. Each device announces itself using a lightweight discovery protocol.  
3. You drop a file into the app.  
4. The receiver accepts the transfer.  
5. File transfers directly peer-to-peer, with no cloud servers involved.

## Privacy

Kitsunet Share does **not**:

send analytics  
use cloud servers  
require an account  
collect data of any kind  

All communication happens **only inside your LAN**.
